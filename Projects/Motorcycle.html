      <h1 >Steps to flip motorcycles</h1>
      <p class="lead">In 2016, together with my friend <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wojtek-sobczyk-3872a9157/">Wojtek</a>, we planned on buying a motorcycle, fixing it and then selling it to gain profit and experience. No sales experience, no mechanical repair experience, we decided to buy an old malfunctioning motorcycle. We kept a spreadsheet of all our expenses and studied the market thoroughly until finding the motorcycle we were looking for. After a month of trying to make it run without success, we realized that we had bought a really complex and complicated bike. What we had was no simple old bike, but the technological innovation of that time, with diverse sensors and electrical functions. After 3 long months of constant work on the bike, through Youtube, the manual and motorcycle forums, we were able to make the bike run and function outstandingly. Eventually, we posted it online and got diverse offers. This experience taught me many notions. Firstly, that your only limit is yourself. You can learn and do anything as long as you believe in yourself. Secondly, hard and proper work always pays off, and thirdly, that although making money can be hard, all you need is the will to get out of the comfort zone and do it.</p>

      <h1 >Fixing the Motorcycle</h1>
      <p class="lead"> Althought I had no background experience on engines, even less motorcycles, my mechanical savvy friend and I had to learn how to fix the motorcycle the hard way, through failure.
        In order to know how to fix the bike, we had to access old archives on how to fix old motorcycles, use Youtube and join motorcycle forums. Fixing the bike was one of my favourite parts of this project. We would spend most of our weekends fixing the bike, most saturdays we would dedicate a solid 10 hours just to experiment and fix the bike, from noon till midnight we would work on the bike.
        Althought the internet is great, we found that it lacked some information, for example how to clean a carburator for our specific bike. </p>
      <br>
      <p class="lead">As seen on the images the only true way to fully learn something is by doing it and understanding it, therefore in order to fix most of the bike we decide to reverse engineer, open up bike components such as the carburator, engine and alternator, understand how it works and fix it.
      By the end of the project we noticed how a complicated issue a regular person would not be able to solve quick, was a simple problem for us. The progress we had made was incredible what would take us hours in the beggining was a quick solve for us. This Project provided Wojtek and I with a new perspective when solving mechanical problems that can be applied to the day to day problems.</p>

      <h1 >How to Sell a Bike built by teens</h1>
      <p class="lead"> Selling the bike was harder than expected, althought Wojtek and I had made sure the bike was safe and sound we had never quetioned our credibility and image due to our young age and lack of expertise on the matter.
      We began selling the bike on popular sites, such as craiglist, Facebook Market and forums, and passing the word through our network. Yet, the same event kept occuring... People would show interest, call us, ask us questions even offer; And then when we met face to face their question would always be "How old are you guys?" & "How much do you guys know about bikes?". </p>
      <p class="lead"> Eventually, we gained experience on the market and learnt how to sell ourselves, sometimes we would say the mechnical work had been done by the previous owner or we would say we were mechanical engineers, while we were just first years. Eventually, with honesty and the right diction we sold the bike.</p>
